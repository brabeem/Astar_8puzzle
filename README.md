# Astar_8puzzle
Implementation of A_star algorithm to solve a 8 puzzle

To run:
  -python Astar_8puzzle/A*SolvingPuzzle.py


This algorithm finds the optimal path  from the initial state to the final state in the game board.
-intial state and final state are given as input in the A*SolvingPuzzle.py as in the picture below:

-We obtain the output as the path through which we reach the goal state as in the picture below which shows the board state 
 through which we move too reach the final state from the intial state.
